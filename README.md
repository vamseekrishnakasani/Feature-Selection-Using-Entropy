# Feature-Selection-Using-Entropy
Multi-Model Performance Evaluation and Feature Selection using Entropy and Information Gain on Datasets

This repository contains Python scripts to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models on the different datasets and perform feature selection using Entropy and Information Gain (IG). The goal is to help data scientists compare different models’ performance while identifying the most relevant features for building accurate models.

Features \
1. Multi-Model Performance Comparison \
  Trains and evaluates the following models: \
  	•	Linear Regression \
  	•	Decision Tree Classifier \
  	•	Random Forest Classifier \
  	•	Gradient Boosting Classifier \

  Calculates and displays: \
  	•	Accuracy \
  	•	Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score) \
  Visualizes performance metrics and provides a tabular summary for easy comparison. \

3. Feature Selection using Entropy and Information Gain \
	•	Entropy Calculation: Quantifies the impurity in the dataset. \
	•	Information Gain (IG): Measures the reduction in entropy after splitting the data based on feature values. \
	•	Feature Ranking: Selects the top features with the highest information gain for model building.
